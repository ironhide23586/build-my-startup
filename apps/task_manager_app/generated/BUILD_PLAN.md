# Project Plan: Simple Task Manager CLI Tool

## Objectives
- Develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing tasks.
- Implement features to:
  - Add tasks with a description.
  - Mark tasks as complete.
  - List all tasks, indicating which are completed.
  - Delete tasks.
- Store tasks in a JSON file for persistence.
- Ensure compatibility with macOS.

## Locations
- **Development Environment**: Local machines of each team member (macOS).
- **Version Control**: GitHub repository for code management and collaboration.
- **Documentation**: README.md file in the project repository.

## Methodology
- **Agile Development**: Follow an iterative approach with regular feedback loops.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for source code management and collaboration.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure functionality and reliability of the CLI tool.

## Workflow
1. **Kickoff Meeting**: Discuss project goals, timelines, and responsibilities.
2. **Design Phase**: Collaborate to outline the architecture and flow of the CLI tool.
3. **Development Phase**:
   - Bob develops the `task_manager.py` file with required functionalities.
   - Diana creates the `README.md` file concurrently.
   - Edward sets up the project structure and manages dependencies.
4. **Testing Phase**: Charlie conducts thorough testing of the CLI tool.
5. **Review Phase**: Team reviews the project, making adjustments as necessary.
6. **Delivery**: Finalize the project and deliver the completed CLI tool.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk of Scope Creep**: Clearly define project objectives and features at the outset. Regularly review progress to ensure alignment with initial goals.
- **Technical Challenges**: Allocate time for research and problem-solving during the development phase. Encourage team collaboration to address issues.
- **Documentation Gaps**: Ensure Diana is involved throughout the development process to capture changes and updates in the README.md.
- **Testing Oversights**: Implement a structured testing plan and schedule to ensure all features are tested before project delivery.
